1) rethink page-title mixin.
  - Maybe break down it into separate blocks.
  - Check functionality on all the pages
2) check updated shape-outside data-shape feature through all the pages
3) check  the updated +image mixin through all the pages
4) add updated gulpfile.js to UPWORK Template (update)
5) Rethink using styles (use inline styles instead of particular classes)
6) Consider possibility of separating CSS: separate file for each page, with criticalCSS. This should exclude unused CSS + fast page loading
7) Considerpossibility of separating all the pages with assets by folder: separate folder for each page
