                p(class="text-blue-dark text-base xs:text-lg lg:text-xl xl:text-2xl font-proxima-bold mt-5 mb-6 lg:mb-10") Today, any brand can win in the marketplace with a powerful brand idea.

                p Big brands, small brands, theyâ€™re all equal in the eyes of the web.

                p A company can win a global market, or create a new market. It can do it quickly, at relatively low cost, and from anywhere in the world.
                p What sets a brand apart, is a great advertising idea. A great idea is a great equalizer, and a great differentiator. Ideas can disrupt markets and scramble old equations.
                p Ideas enable brands to communicate with consumers more persuasively and memorably. With greater engagement and recall.
                p Whether online, in print, on TV or on radio, any advertising message is infinitely more effective when it has a great creative idea behind it. That's how brands engage, enthrall, and connect with their consumers. That's how brands hold their consumers' attention.

                    b(class="text-2xl") Ideas give the advantage to the disrupter, not the disrupted.
                    p(class="mt-0") That's why brands need Tungsten: the ideas agency.

                    p At Tungsten, we think of ideas all day. It's what we do. We create ideas for all types of brands and products. Mostly big ideas that a client can confidently put their resources behind. But sometimes, bite-sized ideas for that fleeting tactical opportunity presented by a trending hashtag.

                    p Ideas are who we are. What we live for. It's why we call ourselves Tungsten.

                    p Ideas, you see, are represented by the light bulb. And at the heart of a light bulb, there is the filament. Made of... yes, made of tungsten.

                    p That's why we named ourselves Tungsten.

                    p To remind ourselves every minute of every day that anything we do, any ad we create, any work that leaves our door, must at its heart have a strong brand idea. Nothing less will do.

                    p A great idea is not just a brand differentiator. It's a great equalizer. An ad with a strong idea penetrates the media clutter with memorable and distinctive messaging that triggers consumer desire, moves you, makes you laugh, makes you buy, makes you donate, makes you join a social trend, adopt a puppy, cut carbon, buy a car, or try a new candy bar.
