                    b On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.

                p They don't know if you're David. And they don't know that you're Goliath. <br> Big brands, small brands, theyâ€™re all equal in the eyes of the web.

                p With a great advertising idea, any brand can win.

                p The power of ideas, and the tools of technology are available to all of us.

                p The traditional advantages of scale, redundant resources, captive talent, proprietary know-how, or access to capital, matter much less today than they once did.

                p Today, a brand can win in the marketplace with a powerful brand idea. That's all you need. A great idea.

                p Ideas are what hold people's attention.

                p Great advertising ideas brought to light by digital media, allow any brand to capture the consumer's attention. A company can win a global market, or create a new market. It can do it quickly, at relatively low cost, and from anywhere in the world.

                p Whether an advertising idea is executed online, in print, on TV or radio, today's technologies allow us to communicate with consumers ever more effectively and persuasively. In less time. At lower budgets. With higher production values. Leading to greater engagement because the brand is perceived as polished, trusted, and reliable.

                p Any marketer can do this faster, cheaper and better than before. We live in the best of times. Disruption gifts us with new opportunities. And scrambles the old equations. Who's the David? Who's the Goliath?

                p It's up for grabs.

                p In an ever fragmenting media landscape, new opportunities present themselves continually. New technology tools continue to be invented, put in the cloud, democratized and made available to everyone. We all have powerful tools at our disposal that allow us to identify and target consumers with near perfect precision. We can all target consumers with dynamic creative right down to individualized messaging. We all have the tools that can crunch zigabytes of big data to tease out consumer insights. What a golden age.

                p Yes, we can all do what we can all do. And that's why the only thing that sets a brand apart from its competitor, is a great advertising idea. A great idea is a great equalizer and a great differentiator.

                p Companies go to market with just an idea. And win. The idea is the weapon. Today, the advantage lies with the disrupter, not the disrupted. With the nimble, the agile, the brave, the foresightful. The advantage lies with those with the ideas.

                p Because everything else, everyone has.

                p How Many Ideas Does A Brand Need?

                p While the tools and technologies are available to all marketers, great ideas aren't equally plentiful.

                p Any advertising message is infinitely more effective when it has a great creative idea behind it. That's how brands engage, enthrall, and connect with their consumers. That's how brands hold their consumers' attention.

                p We're in a time where brands need a constant stream of ideas, and not just the big one.

                p Brands need big ideas, they need little ideas, tactical ideas, medium-sized ideas - brands need lots and lots of ideas to tell their stories at every consumer touch-point.

                p All these ideas work together, converging as one persistent theme, leaving a consistent narrative in the mind of the consumer.

                p That's important, because in an ever fragmenting media landscape with multiple consumer touch-points, a well-expressed idea unites consumers around shared values and ideals, making them identify strongly with the brand.

                p That's why brands need Tungsten: the ideas agency.

                p At Tungsten, we think of ideas all day. It's what we do. We create ideas for all types of brands and products. Mostly big ideas that a client can confidently put their resources behind. But sometimes, bite-sized ideas for that fleeting tactical opportunity presented by a trending hashtag.

                p Ideas are who we are. What we live for. It's why we call ourselves Tungsten.

                p Ideas, you see, are represented by the light bulb. And at the heart of a light bulb, is a filament. Made of... yes, made of Tungsten.

                p That's why we named ourselves Tungsten.

                p To remind ourselves every minute of every day that anything we do, any ad we create, any work that leaves our door, must at its heart have a strong brand idea. Nothing less will do. Because then, we wouldn't be true to our name.

                p As true adverting professionals, we know that a good idea, well articulated and implemented, is more effective for a brand than chasing the shiny new technology fad.

                p A great idea is not just a brand differentiator. It's a great equalizer. An ad with a strong idea penetrates the media clutter with memorable and distinctive advertising that triggers consumer desire, moves you, makes you laugh, makes you buy, makes you donate, makes you join a social trend, adopt a puppy, cut carbon, bye a car, or try a new candy bar. That's the power and beauty of an idea.
