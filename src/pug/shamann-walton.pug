                    Seven candidates were running for the position of Supervisor of District 10 in San Francisco. Polls showed three of them tied at first place.

                        When advertising for  an election, television  must be an essential  component of the  media plan. It appeals  disproportionately to  older viewers. An  audience comprising  homeowners and  business owners --  the demographic  most likely to vote.

                        p.
                            Because our client was a Political Action Committee (PAC), election law restricted us from contacting the candidate or his campaign. This meant we would have to  design a storyboard that would not require the candidate to  appear in a shoot, and we could not ask him to do a voiceover. Tungsten would have to create a commercial using  information already in the public domain.
                        p.
                            Additional regulations required that almost 20-seconds would be taken up by statutory voiceover, making it more than a challenge to fit everything in.
                p.
                    Tungsten scripted a tight audio voiceover, and edited the  video track by using high resolution images available in the  public domain. The completed commercial was then dubbed into Cantonese.  An important but inexpensive value addition that made this  candidate the only one with a direct appeal to Chinese  speakers in the constituency.
                p.
                    With so little time and creative freedom to produce the spot,  the media planning was critical. That's where this political  campaign would be won.

                        A significant segment of the target audience was Black voters.  The client's suggestion was to allocate the bulk of the media  budget into buying airtime at KTVU, a television channel  broadcast from across the bay in Oakland, CA.
                    p(class="").
                        Tungsten recommended not including KTVU  or any other terrestrial TV channel in the  media plan. Instead, our recommendation  was to zone the commercials on cable such  that they would be viewed only within the  City and County of San Francisco. Such  zoning would result in minimal spillover,  giving us greater exposure within the budget  at hand.

                        Normally, a good media plan should expose the advertising  to the consumer (or voter) through multiple mediums that  may include television, but should also include support  mediums like online ads, print, billboard, etc.

                            To reach all voter groups in District 10, we did careful media planning that included Black Entertainment Television (BET), CNN, FX, FOX NEWS, and MSNBC. Additionally, we added to the media mix to reach Chinese-speaking families watching the morning news.

                            After a 6-day burst of 30-second commercials, our media strategy saw Shamann Walton decisively pull ahead on election day, winning a majority of first place votes in San Francisco's ranked choice voting system.

                    p The target audience knows that it's easier for an advertiser to  <b>"Boost"</b> a video on Facebook than to run the same video as a  television spot.
                    p Let's think about this for a moment: Do you remember ever  having seen a political candidate make a public speech where  they sounded ambivalent about their chances of winning?
                    p No.
                    p You'll never see that happen.

                    p Candidates know that if they sound ambivalent, voters will  not "waste" their votes or donations on a candidate who is not  going to win.
                    p By the same principle, when a candidate is confident of their  chances of winning, they don't hesitate to launch their  advertising campaigns.
                    p If a candidate is holding back on their advertising during the  election cycle, it means they are unsure.

                    p It is not enough for voters to see a sponsored post in their  Facebook feeds. Or receive a mass email from the candidate.
                    p Just like everyone else, voters know that online ads are easy  for an advertiser to implement.
                    p Everyone knows that just because they’re seeing the ad,  doesn't mean everyone else is also seeing the ad.
                    p Instead, voters will only feel confident in a candidate  when the candidate advertises in <b> mass media</b>.
                    p When voters see ads on  television, on billboards, or  hear them on the radio, they  know at a glance that those  ads are harder to implement  than online ads.
                    p They know that contracts with TV stations are longer-term,  and budgetary commitments are more substantial. In other words, when voters see a commercial on television,  they subconsciously conclude that the candidate must have a  donor base to support the advertising they are seeing.

Or three times on billboards. Or thrice online.

                p Mass media (such as television) should be a part of that mix in most cases, but especially when building a politician's brand.
                p It's hard to build a politician's brand by relying exclusively on  below-the-line-media.
                p As a parallel example, marketers of consumer products  struggle to build brands with exclusively digital media.
                p Try naming a consumer brand launched in the last 20-years  that your friends have heard of, and has been built entirely on  online advertising. There are examples such as Zappos and a  few others, but these are rare. Especially if the brand does not  depend on the network effect for its growth.
                p Most consumers prefer buying a beer or a handbag that they  know other people will appreciate. Unless someone is really  sure of themselves, they are not likely to turn up at a party  with an unknown brand of beer. It is safer to take something  that will meet broad approval. A brand everyone is familiar  with.
                p That can only happen when the product has been advertised  on mass media where everyone has seen it. Not when it's  targeted one-on-one at individuals on their phone screens,  based on data that says they "have a propensity to purchase  IPAs that are maltier but less hoppy," or a propensity to vote  on a certain political issue.
                p Brands (and politicians) build instant social validation on  television in a way online ads cannot match.

                p When we collectively experience the same emotion as  everyone else around us, that experience is indelible. Sports matches, rock concerts, solar eclipses, Princess Diana's  funeral, these are the defining moments of our lives. Where  were you when the second plane struck?
                p Meanwhile, a 30-second Super Bowl commercial costs $7 million because nothing else delivers an audience of 100  million viewers, instantly catapulting the brand into the national discourse for weeks to come. What a bargain.
                p When a brand is advertised on television, it appears alongside  other brands that are also advertised on television - brands  like Pepsi or Toyota.
                p When a brand is advertised only on mobile screens, it shares  that screen with today's equivalents of snake oil.
                p In recent years, when Facebook, Uber, AirBnb have had an  important announcement, they have chosen to buy full page  ads in traditional newspapers like the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. These marketers are “digital-native  companies.” Indeed, some could not have existed before the  advent of smartphones.
                p They are capable of delivering their message to every  individual in their target audience through a push notification on their own apps.
                p Then why print the message on dead trees?
                p Because a full-page newspaper ad brings a gravity, a self assurance, and a respectability that an online banner ad  cannot.
                p In the 2020s, cinema, radio, outdoor and TV  continue to retain their place in the media mix. New digital  options add to the media planner's toolkit, but rarely replace  existing channels.
                p Can anyone name a medium that was once dominant, but no  longer exists? Even the poster is still around.

                p When consumers see a product (or politician) advertised in  mass media, it helps them distinguish between big,  established marketers, and the less reliable brands. Or to  distinguish between products launched confidently after  extensive R&D by marketers who have a reputation to  protect, and products that are nothing more than an MVP  (minimum viable product) in search of a “product-market fit”.
                p This in turn gives the consumer a certain confidence that they  are spending their income on a product that will be around  for a while and will be well-supported. A brand that will be  socially accepted, making the buyer look good amongst their  peers, because those peers appreciate their choices.
                p (And the same considerations apply equally when advertising  a politician or a social cause).
                p Consumers rarely find the same level of confidence in brands  (or for that matter politicians) that are only discoverable  online.
                p Mass media helps us to validate, and be <em>validated</em>.
                p Most advertisers understand this intuitively, even if they do  not articulate it. Even advertisers with the smallest of budgets  would love their products to be advertised on mass media.  Yet, they overlook television and its benefits, believing that  small brands are excluded from TV.
                p They wrongly believe they can’t afford the combined costs of  airtime and production. Or that even if they had the budget,  they wouldn't have the wherewithal to buy and implement television advertising. They think TV is only within the reach  of big companies. (Which of course, is also a perception  consumers have, and therefore, a reason to be on TV).
                p It's common to hear advertisers sigh: <b>“Online video is hard.”</b>  So imagine how they might feel about creating commercials  for broadcast television.
                p As Supervisor Shamann Walton's case study demonstrates,  good media planning can make it possible for advertisers  with small budgets to be on TV on national programming,  and be more effective than on other mediums.
